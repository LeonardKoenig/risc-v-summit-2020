    "description": "Want to run Linux on open hardware? This talk will explore how the RISC-V, an open instruction set (ISA), and open source FPGA tools can be leveraged to achieve that goal.I will explain how myself and others at Hackaday Supercon teamed up to get Linux running on a RISC-V soft-core in the ECP5 FPGA on the conference badge. I will introduce Migen, LiteX and Vexriscv, and explain how they enabled us to quickly implement an SoC in the FPGA capable of running Linux.I will also explore other Linux-capable open source RISC-V implementations, and how some are being used in industry. I will highlight that OpenHW Group has adopted the PULP Ariane from ETH Zurich for its Core-V CVA64 implementation. Finally, I will look at what Linux-capable \"hard\" RISC-V SoC's currently exist, and what is on the horizon for 2020 and 2021.Key TakeawaysThis talk is should be relevant to people who are interested in building open hardware systems capable of running Linux. It should also be useful to people who are curious about RISC-V. Software engineers may find it exciting to learn how Python can be used to for chip-level design with Migen and LiteX, and simplify building a System-on-Chip (SoC) for an FPGA.",

    "description": "Running state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on top of a cheap and low-power microcontroller can be considered the holy grail of current research on edge embedded devices. This requires beating fundamental obstacles: 1) achieve a sufficient compute throughput within the allotted power envelope; 2) squeeze the DNN model footprint to better fit within restricted (< 1MB) on-chip memory resources; 3) minimize off-chip memory bandwidth if the DNN still cannot fit within on-chip memory. In this talk, we present the vertically integrated flow, fully open-source flow we designed to deploy DNNs on top of systems based on the RISC-V based PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low-Power) platform, such as GreenWaves Technologies GAP-8. Starting from DNN specification in a high-level framework (PyTorch), our flow uses open-source tools to cover all the steps for DNN deployment passing through mixed-precision quantization, memory-aware tensor tiling, down to optimized primitives used for execution on the PULP cores, augmented with the xPULP extensions to the RISC-V ISA. We showcase how the flow enables running mobile-grade DNNs in real-time on a GAP-8 SoC consuming less than 250 mW in the highest-performance operating point.Key TakeawaysUnderstand what makes deploying DNNs on low-power microcontrollers a challenging taskKnow the PULP RISC-V open-source hardware ecosystem and software tools for DNN deploymentUnderstand the advantages of an open-source, vertically integrated framework \"from Python to silicon\"",

This session discusses and demonstrates advanced debug capability of heterogeneous SOC comprised of RISC-V and non-RISC-V processor cores. The advanced debug techniques include processor trace of RISC-V hardware. The debugging of RISC-V designs is greatly enhanced by the ability to use trace information to debug backwards and forwards along with re-debugging a traced program section.Key TakeawaysCommercial RISC-V based designs often include non-RISC-V processors and IPComprehensive debug of the design requires debugging all IP independently and concurrentlyTRACE32 allows you to define the interaction between separate processors cores in a complex SOCThe use of on-chip and off-chip trace provide a more complete way to debug complex SOC and better understand the interactions of all the processors.",

    "description": "Esperanto Technologies has developed an accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications.In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company's new ET-SoC-1, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion is a leaner in-order multithreaded core with a large vector/tensor coprocessor designed from a clean sheet of paper for machine-learning applications.The chip's performance and efficiency comes from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, Esperanto's proprietary instruction-set extensions for machine learning, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom low-voltage circuits. In this way, Esperanto delivers more performance per watt than competing fixed-function designs without compromising flexibility.The ET-SoC-1 accelerates every layer in machine-learning models, not just the simple ones. The presentation also describes Esperanto's software stack, which is based on Esperanto's RISC-V neural network compiler and industry-standard frameworks such as PyTorch, ONNX, and Glow. Coding to the hardware is unnecessary; Esperanto's PCI Express accelerator cards drop into existing systems and immediately deliver many times the performance of the best x86, GPU and FPGA solutions, taking data center performance density to previously unattained levels.Key TakeawaysEsperanto's new ET-SoC-1 features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores, the ET-Maxion and the ET-MinionThe ET-Minion is a lean in-order multithreaded core with a large vector/tensor coprocessor designed from a clean sheet of paper for machine-learning applicationsWith a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom low-voltage circuits, the ET-SoC-1 delivers more performance per watt than competing fixed-function ML accelerators without compromising flexibility",

    "description": "Edge compute and storage infrastructures will increasingly drive autonomous decision-making processes, using data sets from a wide range of sensors. With a growing number of diverse data sets from varied sources, it can be challenging to guarantee the data's integrity. For example, academic research shows that manipulation of machine learning training data can create malicious backdoors in the model. We need to improve overall data trustworthiness to avoid manipulation of data driven automated decisions by increasing the trust of data capture devices and downstream data processing and storage systems. The end goal is an end-to-end trusted data ecosystem.In this talk, we discuss how a RISC-V based solution helps to protect data integrity by safeguarding its provenance. We created a proof-of-concept with off-the-shelf RISC-V hardcores, the open source Keystone Enclave Framework, implementing a Trusted Computing Group DICE based cryptographic identity, all secured by enclaves. The cryptographic device identities are then used to create verifiable integrity for data coming from a data capture device.Additionally, we consider how to improve the overall security of such a system with OpenTitan, an open-source silicon root of trust project. Although OpenTitan is still under development, we show how it benefits a data-storage environment and discuss how it helps to improve the overall trustworthiness of data. Having deployed OpenTitan onto a FPGA, we discuss our proof-of-concept findings regarding the integration into a (small) storage platform, including how external systems will interact with the root of trust.Key TakeawaysThere is an increasing need to improve the trustworthiness of data created at the Edge. RISC-V and Keystone Secure Enclaves can be used isolate sensitive functionality used to protect the integrity of data at time of capture. We can further improve data trustworthiness when adding an open source-based root of trust to the system. What we learned during our proof of concept when integrating an OpenTitan root of trust.",

    "description": "From 2018, the spectre security hole has been recognized as one of the most severe issues in computer architecture. It exploits the speculative execution mechanisms of modern high-performance processors. By reading the side-effects of the cache, the attacker could recover the secret information from the memory which being processed by an error-free program.Researches proving that this kind of side-channel attack successfully worked on out-of-order processors. Accordingly, it is now continuing to experiment on a heterogeneous multi-core processor. This hybrid processor would combine and enhance the distinct advantages of the Out-of-Order and In-Order processors. Therefore, it becomes a relevant target for this security's scenario.With the various accessible products of RISC-V ecosystems, there are many open and non-restrictive licenses processor's architectures. Researchers, designers are given chances to propose, implement, test and evaluate any attack schemes on the RISC-V processors.This work shows the study and implementation of the side-channel attack via cache in a hybrid multi-core RISC-V processor.

    "description": "RISCV provides a tremendous opportunity to innovate in the post-Moore era. Several applications domains such as motor control, industrial protocols, DNNs, and signal processing benefit from instruction set specialization. As the role of architectural specialization becomes central to achieving higher energy efficiency, we present a new tool - called rvnewop - that accelerates the process of identifying and encoding custom instructions over the RISCV ISA baseline.RISCV ISA baseline starts out with a small set of about 40 instructions focused on integer arithmetic. Several standard extensions such as F (floating point), D (double precision), Q (quad precision), V (vectors), M (multiplication-division) and so on offer specialized capabilities that may be incorporated over the baseline, based on application domain requirements. Our tool - rvnewop - builds on top of these standard extensions. Using traces of execution of programs drawn from an application domain, rvnewop recommends new RISC instructions, and outputs their instruction encodings.To provide a usable tool framework, rvnewop automatically updates the GNU assembler, and the Spike simulator with these new encodings. Further, it also automatically creates an assembly version of input programs leveraging the new instructions. This enables architects to rapidly explore ISA specializations without being constrained by the lack of tool support. We will demonstrate these capabilities of the tool with a live demo.rvnewop is a tool under active development. While the current version incorporates data flow analysis over basic blocks, there are opportunities to perform analysis at a a larger program-scope in order to identify additional specializations.Key TakeawaysSpecialization / Customization opportunity with RISCVOpen-source Python framework to accelerate customization experimentsAutomatic tool chain updates to GNU assembler and SpikeExtensible framework -- allowing developers to perform additional program analysis or to link to other tools (simulator, codegen or design generation)",

    "description": "OmniXtend continues to evolve as an open cache-coherent protocol ready to be deployed in real world applications. The question is how to provide the necessary support for OmniXtend to build a scalable system with thousands of nodes. Designing, verifying, and deploying of these scale-out systems in hardware is time consuming. We present a two-fold approach to build and accelerate the development of OmniXtend scale-out systems.  (i) We propose an initialization and configuration protocol defining a simple yet race-free approach to setting up multiple OmniXtend nodes during boot. This configuration protocol enables switching the system between two models: a single instance of an operating system over several nodes with Non-Uniform memory access (NUMA) or independent instances of an operating system on different nodes sharing memory.  (ii) We also provide a software simulation/emulation framework which implements the OmniXtend protocol and an Omnixtend system emulation using Qemu. The simulation framework helps to expedite the debugging and verification of the protocol while a full system emulation allows deploying OmniXtend compute nodes in software alongside the hardware, paving the way for OmniXtend to be the ubiquitous choice for building large scalable cache-coherent systems.

The established SoC flows have a couple of standard assumptions \u2013 test benches written for UVM SystemVerilog flows and known good processor IP from a mainstream supplier. Now with RISC-V, processor IP cores can be from a variety of sources, including commercial, open source and internally developed. In addition, options to extend or modify a processor make the processor DV task something for all adopters will need to consider.The RISC-V compliance suite is an essential starting point for any test plan, yet without a coverage and analysis strategy the flexibility of RISC-V can appear to be a complex undertaking. A key part of any test plan is the metrics used to define the milestones of progress and a detailed approach to analysis and resolution is key. Identification of an issue is useful, but getting insights into the behaviors and underlying issues are essential for the timely resolution. Early detection and analysis can avoid the costs and delays of a late stage discovery, as RISC-V custom extensions support multi-core communications the IP core and SoC verification stages are overlapping, especially in the case of many core arrays for AI and Machine Learning applications.

    "description": "RISC-V ISA was designed to be configurable and extensible. Like the SweRV family of cores from Western Digital, open-source RISC-V cores offer a strong starting point for researchers and companies looking to build custom CPUs. Verification of these custom CPUs requires test generators, instruction set simulators (ISS), and RTL simulators -- all of which are available as open-source tools. What is needed is a unified environment to jump-start the verification work with minimal effort.   Lampro Mellon is a global SoC design and verification services company, working on verification of cutting-edge RISC-V processors, and development of BSP and Linux drivers for RISC-V and ARM-based systems. Within the domain of SoC design and verification, LM has created LM RISC-V DV that combines RISCV-DV test generator, Spike ISS, and SweRV core into a seamless end-to-end flow -- from random assembly test generation and RTL compilation to post-simulation comparison. This environment accelerates the design and verification of cores, which results in reduced design cycle times and cost. And the great thing is; LM RISC-V DV is also open-source.    Session Take-aways   A major obstacle to reuse of open-source IPs and tools is the lack of an integrated environment.

    "description": "RISC-V is gaining traction for AI and Machine Learning applications as system designers migrate cloud-based algorithms to dedicated hardware. RISC-V offers the options to fine tune the processor features and configure vector engines to accelerate the key functions. In many core arrays the processors can be a mix of capabilities for a true heterogeneous solution. The RISC-V support of custom instruction and extension can be used for both new functions and also lightweight inter-processor communications across the arrays of processors.Using virtual platforms allows system designers to explore various configurations and arrangements of processors and test these with the full application workloads and real-world datasets. Given the broad range of target markets looking at AI solutions, RISC-V is uniquely positioned to scale across all the compute requirements.As the front end of the design exploration moves towards the detailed design phase the reference model approach allows the hardware developers to use a functional model as part of the design specification and help develop the test bench with behavioral models. Developing software before silicon is useful for the internal project teams, but in many markets the option to provide early evaluation platforms to prospects and partners is a key way to develop support and interest for these new devices.Based on experience with advanced AI designs this talk with highlight the virtual platforms role in these new market segments with multi-processor design techniques illustrated with examples of current design projects.

While it provides good results on the positive testing side (the implemented instructions work as expected), it requires significant manual effort and neglects negative testing (consider illegal instructions to also ensure that no additional/unexpected behavior is accidentally added). This leaves a large gap in compliance testing. In this talk we present a fuzzing-based test-suite generation approach to complement the official compliance test-suite and close this gap. We leverage advanced coverage-guided fuzzing techniques in combination with a custom coverage metric and fuzzing mutator to boost the efficiency of our approach.

    "description": "The security of computer systems relies on the strict isolation of applications. Memory protection is the established isolation mechanism, and is well supported by modern ISAs. However, leakage through the timing of events, called timing channels, has long been known as a way to bypass this isolation. The recent Spectre attack has demonstrated that microarchitectural timing channels, where the leakage exploits hardware state hidden by the ISA, are a major security concern. We demonstrate that microarchitectural state-induced leakage can be significant even on a simple application-class 64-bit RISC-V core (ARIANE from the PULP project), measuring up to 3.7 bits per preemption (order of kilobits per second). In this presentation, we will introduce the concept of time protection as a systematic prevention mechanism. We show how the RISC-V ISA can be easily extended to support time protection, and demonstrate  based on an actual implementation  that it is highly effective in preventing leakage while imposing negligible hardware and run-time overhead. The exact form of this ISA extension is presently being discussed in the RISC-V Privileged Spec Technical Committee.Key TakeawaysMicroarchitectural timing channels are a real security threat and exist on current RISC-V systemsTime protection can be the solution: making history-dependent state architecturally visible and controllable by the OSThe implementation of time protection is mostly straightforward and comes at negligible cost This is an opportunity for RISC-V to proactively solve a critical and fundamental security problem",

    "description": "We introduce the category of Cluster CPUs. These are general purpose CPUs that run existing RISC-V binaries, but are micro-architected for applications that run on clusters of servers. They take advantage of the fact that cluster ready applications have many active software threads available, and leverage that to gain similar performance to Out of Order CPUs, but at an order of magnitude less power, and less silicon area.The result is 12 times more performance per dollar (of total cost of ownership) versus existing rackmount servers.Intensivate's IntenScale card is a PCIe card designed to hold 21 Cluster CPU chips, each paired to its own 32GB of RAM. It fits existing PCIe slots designed to hold GPUs, and sports 4x 100G connections direct to the Top of Rack switch. In this topology, each chip on the IntenScale card is viewed as an independent server (diskless, that boots over the network) with its own IP address, that boots the standard RISC-V operating systems. By adding such a card to a Host and wiring it to the Top of Rack switch, the network gains 21 more servers, each with 16 cores (which means 256 hardware threads), and 32GB of main memory.The efficiency of such a CPU on the already large and growing class of applications that run on clusters will cause Cluster CPUs to become a new category of standard computation hardware in the data center, sitting alongside GPUs and AI accelerators. RISC-V enables this revolution. Key TakeawaysCluster CPUs are a new category of CPU that increase the computation per dollar by 12 (twelve) times, on existing software (that runs on clusters of servers).Cluster CPUs will become a new form of standard equipment in the data center.The RISC-V eco system has reduced the cost to deliver this silicon by a factor of 10.As a result of the cost and effort reduction, a RISC-V processor will be the first to market in this category, an indication that the stage is set for RISC-V to play a major role in post-Moore's law silicon innovation.",

    "description": "In this talk, we describe a new coverage driven solution for RISC-V formal verification. With our solution, the user specifies scenarios of interest in a spreadsheet, and our app-based solution produces evidence of those scenarios by providing visual feedback in the form of waveforms if those scenarios are possible. If a scenario is not possible, we show that it is not by showing that they are unreachable regardless of the input stimulus. Additionally, we \"prove\" that those scenarios specified by the user will \"always work correctly\"; not only \"can\" they happen, but they \"must always\" happen. We produce these results without requiring the user to:1. Write a single line of test case2. Write any input sequence3. Write any checkers or scoreboards4. Write any constraints5. Write any line of verification codeOur GUI based solution produces:1. Formal proofs that all instructions in the ISA have been implemented correctly in the RISC-V design regardless of any input stimulus.2. Cover properties coded per instruction provide visual feedback to the end-user.3. Structural coverage metrics reported from the formal verification tool provide reachability analysis.4. Our ISA coverage analyzer provides proofs of correctness for each row in the spreadsheet showing without doubt that scenarios of interest can always work correctly, and also visual feedback is obtained in the form of waveforms when the scenarios are reachable.5.

By providing great scalability and performance to address diversified requirements, the Vector Extension not only expands the capabilities of RISC-V processors, but is also accompanied with unavoidable design complexity and verification challenges with enormous instruction variations.In this talk, we will first introduce the framework and the latest status of RISCV-DV, an open source verification platform for random RISC-V instruction generation. Then, we will review common verification issues of vector extension and provide a solution using our recent vector extension contribution to RISCV-DV.

    "description": "Building masked software implementations in a secure manner is a challenging task with many pitfalls. Several publications discuss these challenges, which typically boil down to the fact that masking schemes make certain assumptions on the underlying CPU hardware, like independence of leakage, that are not satisfied in practice. In order to remove such side-channel leakage, the typical approach in practice is to iteratively fix and empirically verify the security of the implementation. This is an error-prone and time-consuming process.We overcome the current situation and present the first approach for co-design and co-verification of masked software implementations on CPUs. First, we present Coco, a tool  that allows us to provide security proofs at the gate-level for the execution of a masked software implementation on a concrete CPU. Using Coco, we analyze the popular 32-bit RISC-V Ibex core, identify all design aspects that violate the security of our tested masked software implementations and perform corrections, mostly in hardware. The resulting secured Ibex core has an area overhead around 10%, the runtime of software on this core is largely unaffected, and the formal verification with Coco of an, e.g., first-order masked Keccak S-box running on the secured Ibex core takes around 156 seconds.Key TakeawaysHow can we verify that the execution of masked software implementations written is leakage-free on a given CPU?How can we identify which which parts of CPUs are the main sources of leakage?What can we do to eliminate these leakage sources?   All these questions are discussed using the RISC-V Ibex core and assembly programs written in RISC-V assembly.",

    "description": "In this session, you will learn how the RISC-V ecosystem is helping in the cutting-edge research to build the advanced quantum testbed. Current state-of-the-art quantum computers are typically controlled by an ad-hoc combination of classical control electronics. These classical control electronics are highly diversified and see little technology reuse across different system implementations. In all cases, the control electronics must meet stringent real-time and sensitivity constraints that will become increasingly stringent with the growing size of quantum chips. Early experiments all indicate that long-term success of quantum computing hinges on developing better qubit designs combined with a more effective classical control hardware pipeline that is scalable, extensible, and able to provide real-time guarantees. Berkeley Lab researchers address these limitations by developing a custom and open FPGA control system architecture. This talk will describe the quantum system architecture with a RISC-V processor extended to support special quantum operations and analog backend communication. The talk will be accompanied by an FPGA prototype demo implemented using the SiFive Freedom platform.  Key Takeaways The attendees will learn about the cutting-edge technologies that are developed at the Berkeley Lab using RISC-V ecosystem. ",

    "description": "One of hurdles for achieving market adoption of AI processors is the programming model and tools for software developers. There are now hundreds of neural network processors achieving great performance, demonstrated with today's benchmarks, but when it comes to integration and usability, the gap can be huge.RISC-V is based on openness; ISA specification, industry contributions for systems and an embraced ecosystem. This must extend to an open software platform, providing software developers an easy way to harness the familiar benefits already available on CPUs and GPUs.Today, system-on-chip manufacturers are building specialist accelerator processors using the RISC-V architecture, taking advantage of the Vectorized extensions to provide exceptional performance that matches compute performance mostly seen on GPUs today. The availability of a familiar and well defined programming model is an absolute requirement if expecting to successfully bring these new processors to market.Just like The Khronos group brought the OpenGL open standard interface to developers 20 years ago combining the expertise of the whole industry, the same approach is happening for programmers of AI systems. The Khronos standards OpenCL and SYCL are already extensively adopted for compute systems, and are gaining momentum in many market segments, from HPC exascale systems to automotive ADAS.This presentation outlines the software developer needs, how OpenCL and SYCL provides the core infrastructure for the ecosystem of other standards, how they integrate onto a RISC-V SoC and outlines the benefits to software developers of a healthy ecosystem.Key Takeaways:A path from AI and C++ development onto RISC-V Vector processorsThe existing ecosystem around available thanks to SYCLUnderstand how SYCL provides a robust and well defined programming model for software developers",

    "description": "This talk will focus on the award-winning past and on-going educational activities at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, Spain and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in Computer Architecture for safety critical systems, which became possible thanks to the RISC-V initiative. Functional safety and security are two domains of paramount importance for current and future safety-critical systems, such as the ones used in transportation (automotive, avionics, space, railway), medical or control-systems. However, the trend in computer architecture education and practice has been traditionally focused only on performance. Moreover, despite the significant interest of safety-critical industries in RISC-V and the large market sectors they represent, the number of available cores with functional safety features is significantly under-represented compared to the sheer amount of RISC-V cores, especially the open-sourced ones. In the 2019 edition of the advanced graduate Processor Design course at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), the students implemented and verified such features in several open-source RISC-V designs, gaining hands-on experience with these design principles. For this activity, Dr. Kosmidis was awarded the RISC-V Educator of the Year Award. This talk will provide the details of the developed and open sourced modifications of these RISC-V designs, as well as the new developments which will be completed in the fall semester of the 2020 edition of the course. If time permits, the synergies between this course and other entry level courses at UPC and the tape-out activities of the first educational RISC-V processor in Spain by BSC will be covered, too.

We have recently proposed OmniXtend: a cache-coherency protocol architecture, that exports Tilelink cache-coherence messages on the top of L2 ethernet frames. This architecture allows heterogenous systems that use same TileLink cache-coherence protocol to share the memory in a coherent fashion. In this study, we report the results of four (4) RISC-V nodes, each running 4 independent RISC-V harts, connecting via commercial ethernet switch, and establishing ccNUMA (cache coherent non-uniform memory access) architecture. We report detailed study of local and non-local (i.e. going through ethernet switch) cache access latencies, and propose several software models for OmniXtend-backed architectures.",

    "description": "Modern cellular communications use the Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) air interface. In such a system, data is transmitted in symbols which are grouped in slots. In 5G these slots can range from 0.25 and 0.125 ms. The scheduling of the traffic carried in these slots is done by the MAC layer. It schedules traffic to the network (uplink) as well from the network to the User (downlink).Efficient 5G base stations are being designed and deployed to handle not just many, many users supporting many 5G cells but even have support for several separate mobile operators. Each operator may require its own software.The physical layer (PHY) must process the data (both control and user) passed to it by the MAC to fill in the slots and symbols for transmission and reception. If the PHY fails to meet the strict timing constraints whole slots of data will be lost requiring recovery mechanisms.In this talk we present a heterogeneous SoC which implements a 5G NG small cell base station using clusters of RISCVs and dedicated DSPs. Each of the RISCVs will be running the Zephyr OS. The talk will also show how the strict timing constraints are continuously monitored non-intrusively and how embedded analytics provides useful insights into the behaviour of the base station.

    "description": "Developing secure IoT devices is challenging. These resource-constrained devices typically lack the hardware resources necessary for the trusted execution of the many complex 3rd party software components required for secure operations. Over time, established platform vendors have developed light-weight Trusted Execution Environments and relative embedded software stacks optimized for their smaller processors. However, none of these are available to RISC-V developers who are left alone figuring out how to shield trusted code from unverified 3rd party software libraries and how to safely combine these components into the single firmware image powering their commercial applications.In this presentation, Cesare Garlati and Sandro Pinto, renowned embedded security experts and long-time passionate supporters of RISC-V, will introduce the industry-first free and open secure IoT stack for RISC-V. The presentation covers all hardware and software components necessary to build state-of-the-art device, firmware, and cloud management service. These include RISC-V 32-bit SoC fpga, multi-zone Trusted Execution Environment, safety-critical RTOS, TCP/IP connectivity, TLS ECC cryptography, and MQTT client and broker providing telemetry and OTA applications deployment and firmware updates. All components are built on free and open standards, distributed under permissive licensing, and freely available for download from GitHub.In addition, the presentation will include a short live demo of a real-world RISC-V IoT device securely connected to a commercial cloud provider. Key TakeawaysBuilding secure IoT devices with RISC-V is challenging because the ISA lacks a standard Trusted Execution Environment and a relative standard secure IoT firmware.To develop secure IoT applications, the MultiZone Secure IoT Stack provides state-of-the-art 32-bit SoC IP, TEE, RTOS, TCP/IP, TLS, ECC, PKI, MQTT, OTA firmware updates, and cloud broker.The secure IoT stack works with any RISC-V processors and cloud providers, it is built on free and open standards, distributed under permissive licensing, and available today at https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-secure-iot-stack.",

    "description": "Memory compression allows data to be stored compactly in memory, thereby increasing memory capacity without increasing the amount of physical memory. This translates into higher performance and thereby a higher performance/watt ratio.For server systems, when memory capacity per socket has maxed out, adding more sockets to increase the amount of physical memory leads to lower system performance and cost. For smart devices, such as smartphones, memory compression can offer higher memory capacity thereby boosting the user-perceived value at lower cost.We present Ziptilion\u2122, the first general-purpose IP-block product for integration in microprocessor SoCs, such as RISC-V, developed by the fabless Swedish company ZeroPoint Technologies. It enables an unprecedented memory expansion by a factor 2.5X and 30% more effective memory bandwidth. We discuss how the IP-block is architected and integrated into a RISC-V based system. A first technical contribution is new statistical, real-time compression algorithms offering substantially higher compression ratios than what is known from state of the art. Another technical contribution is the novel approach taken by Ziptilion\u2122 to manage the compressed memory in an operating-system (OS) transparent way through by forming an ultrafast large RAM-based swap space from the memory freed up by compression. Finally, Ziptilion\u2122 offers novel optimizations at the hardware level to deal with ultrafast memory-side translation between the OS-physical and the compressed address spaces. Key TakeawaysThe audience will learn about a new product IP that can be integrated in a RISC-V SoC, significantly improving the system memory performance/watt by applying a memory compression technology. The IP solution is independent of the underline memory technologies (e.g., DDR, HBM, NVMe). The presentation will show an evaluation of the IP product presenting performance, power and area.The audience will gain technical knowledge in the field of memory compression and will be exposed to technical challenges and pragmatic solutions.The audience will learn about a novel HW/SW IP solution integrated to RISC-V systems. Thus insights will be gained about the integration process: how we integrate the HW part in the memory access path and the SW path in the Linux OS.",

    "description": "System on a chip (SoC) design and manufacturing have become among the necessities of the modern IC design world. However, giving the timing criticality, it is incredibly costly for a developer to discover a bug after the long process of creating the final layout. The developer would then go back to reviewing HDL files and carrying out the hardening flow from scratch. This process has become rather systematic and algorithmic, which explains the increase in the number of available open-source tools that carry out chip design. With keen observation, we also find that the similarities between different systems on chips are common Intellectual Properties (IPs) that communicate with the master via the system bus. Henceforth came the idea of automating the process of generating the HDL code of an SoC utilizing verified open-source IPs from a library that is easily extensible by users.In this work, we present an open-source workflow capable of generating layout from high-level deep embedded SoC architectural description. The flow starts with a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) representation of the SoC and ends with a verified layout (GDS2) for the SoC. The workflow relies on open-source EDA tools and IPs and skywater-pdk SKY130, the recently released open-source Physical Design Kit (PDK). The flow incorporates the OpenROAD framework and was used to implement striVe SoC (sent for manufacturing) and several other SoC configurations (to be tape-out in 8/2020) that evaluate and demonstrates design and flow KPI's with proven silicon performance.

    "description": "Many security attacks focus on the vulnerabilities of r platforms and access or tamper sensitive data. Those attacks trigger malicious bus transactions to achieve their goals. Thus, system designers need mechanisms to distinguish safe transactions from malicious transactions. To build a secure platform, such mechanisms are indispensable.In this talk, we will introduce a secure platform in which every transaction is ensured its permission. Bus masters, e.g. CPU and DMA, are the ones issuing transactions. We already have PMP in charge of regulating transactions issued from RISC-V processors. Here, we will propose an enhanced IOPMP, enIOPMP for short, to regulate transactions issued from the rest, where IOPMP is originated from the previous proposals in TEE Task Group.The step of initializing PMP and enIOPMP is crucial. Secure boot plays an important role here, so we will provide a recommended flow to initialize a secure platform: when and how to initialize PMP and enIOPMP. The properly-initialized PMP or enIOPMP are considered as regulated checkers. In addition, the key enhanced features of the proposed enIOPMP are presented, e.g. speculation, violation handling, and master-id arrangement.Security monitor is in charge of manipulating these regulated checkers after secure boot. Some usage cases of security monitor will also be presented.Contemporary IC designs may have several smaller and even nested subsystems, which may have their own sensitive data to protect. At the end of the talk, we will introduce the concept of MID-space and IOPMP-gateways to architect a bigger secure platform from smaller secure subsystems.Session Take-awaysFeatures of Enhanced IOPMPBuild secure platforms by PMP + IOPMP + secure bootArchitect Larger Secure Platforms",

    "description": "From a semiconductor hardware perspective, tradeoffs between the three key metrics of Power, Performance and Area (PPA) are well known and critically important in the optimization of a design. In this paper, results from a set of redefined \"software PPA\" metrics are examined. Based on porting multiple real-world production microcontroller security and other applications from Arm Cortex-M cores to open source RISC-V cores, these revisited metrics were studied. Two different security applications, both functioning as independent \"black box\" secure enclaves, were analyzed in detail. Using the redefined definitions, performance in terms of execution cycle counts and dynamic instruction pathlength, power in terms of silicon dissipation plus memory access types and rates and dynamic stack footprint, and static code size as a proxy for area are presented and compared. Key TakeawaysReal-world static code density comparisons from production software packagesEffects of standard compiler optimization flags versus static code sizesRelative static code sizes between GCC, LLVM and proprietary compilers Real-time performance metric comparisons ",

    "description": "Embedded systems development usually starts with gathering requirements but the more complex the device is, the more difficult it is to accurately establish the needs. Once you do that, you find or make customer hardware that meets those requirements and then the software development phase begins. However, it is likely that at some point it will turn out that not all of your original design choices were optimal so you update your hardware and software and start another development cycle, which is costly and time consuming. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. This talk will present modern methods of system development based on modular open source solutions, such as Antmicro\u2019s simulation framework Renode and the soft SoC generator LiteX. Such an approach solves some of the typical problems that designers encounter when creating embedded systems, as it allows them to develop hardware in an agile and incremental way, focusing on the needs of the product rather than being limited by initial hardware choices. We will also present how Renode, which has extensive RISC-V support, enables pre-hardware development of software, giving system architects the means to evaluate their design choices at a very early stage of the cycle, and to test the whole hardware/software setup in a Continuous Integration environment, which translates into a more efficient development process and a better final product. Featuring a number of RISC-V cores besides other architectures, the open source SoC generator, LiteX and its ecosystem are well supported in Renode, while its Zephyr and Linux ports, both actively developed by Antmicro and used in their industrial systems, as well as the dynamic community make it easy to start developing in LiteX. The presentation will explain how these modular open source solutions make for a robust set of tools that can transform advanced systems development. Session Takeaway The audience will learn how open source and modular tools can be used to overcome challenges that are common in embedded systems development.",
