    "description": "The RISC-V vector extension has been designed to support complex arithmetic operations which operate over an array of data items to enable acceleration of computationally intensive tasks such as AI/ML and deep learning. The flexible architecture design requires target implementations to support a very large combination of input/output values for all the instructions. This scales up the complexity of ensuring the functional correctness of vector instructions and their interoperability with other system components such as MMU, caches, interrupts resulting in a huge challenge for the verification engineers. Writing directed tests for these combinations will be a long drawn process with high development costs and susceptible to manual errors.  In this session, we present a hybrid approach implemented in STING design verification tool which involves a mix of constrained random, graph based test generation and directed testing guided with coverage results, to get maximum possible verification throughput. The high level design choices in the tool to address randomization of SEW, LMUL and related CSRs, while ensuring that the resulting test is architecturally correct at the same time, will also be covered. The methodology allowed the stimulus to be very configurable with a high degree of interaction with other subsystems of the CPU, and as a result was very successful in finding a lot of bugs in a number of open source simulators and RTL implementations.

    "description": "Floating-point (FP) arithmetic is essential in many applications of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) domain. In programmable devices, FP operations can be performed by dedicated instructions or by software emulation. For applications that use FP operations only sporadically, software emulation is a suitable solution as it avoids the use of expensive datapaths. In contrast, when FP instructions dominate the application, having a performant hardware floating-point unit (FPU) is better. However, both the extra area required by a full-fledged FPU and the code size overhead, introduced by the software functions to emulate FP instructions on the integer datapath, are too expensive for low-cost microcontrollers. We present an IEEE-754-2008-compliant RISC-V FPU (Tiny-FPU) optimized for circuit area while being higher-performance than the software emulation functions provided by the GCC low-level runtime library (libgcc). A small RISC-V core coupled with Tiny-FPU achieves up to 15.5x and 18.5x speedup compared to the same integer-only core using software emulation when executing intensive single- and double-precision FP workloads, respectively. Tiny-FPU exploits multi-cycle execution to use fewer and smaller components in a time-multiplexed fashion, reducing the area by 37% for a single-precision implementation and by 53% for a double-precision one compared to a high-performance and energy-efficient FPU. The proposed FPU can compute additions, multiplications, fused multiply-adds, comparisons, sign injections, and casts.

The term \u2018Electronics System Level (ESL)\u2019 have been used in the industry for nearly two decades now. Different people use it in different context, with different meanings. It can be primarily generalized as the collection of methodologies that enables \u2018Hardware-Software Co-Design\u2019 and \u2018Raising the abstraction of chip design above RTL\u2019. The different technologies that are used to enable ESL methodologies are: C, C++, SystemC / TLM2.0 (IEEE 1666-2011), Python, UPF3.0 (IEEE1801-2015), IP-XACT (IEEE1685-2014), Portable Stimulus (new Accellera standard). ESL methodologies are not supposed to replace the traditional RTL-GDS flow, but rather co-exist with existing flow and augment it to perform various advanced activities which are not feasible with traditional flow. It enables Pre-Silicon firmware development, Architecture exploration to optimize power & performance early in the cycle at system level, High-Level Synthesis (HLS), SoC Level simulation, System level simulation, Hardware-Software co-design and co-verification. Some re-usable modelling infrastructure can be developed for RISC-V, that helps the companies to quickly deploy ESL methodologies in their flow.

    "description": "In the last decade, virtualization has become a key-enabling technology not only for servers but also for several embedded industries such as automotive and industrial control. As these typically have mixed-criticality requirements, static partitioning hypervisors, which feature minimal trusted computing bases, are a perfect fit for achieving consolidation while guaranteeing freedom-from-interference, but often depend on hardware virtualization support. The RISC-V hypervisor extension specification draft is reaching a state of full maturity, but, unfortunately, it is not yet ratified, which means no silicon featuring full hardware virtualization support is available and will probably not be for the foreseeable future.We've ported Bao, an open-source static partitioning hypervisor, to RISC-V using the QEMU hypervisor extension implementation. To perform a meaningful and realistic evaluation of Bao, we've implemented the latest version of the hypervisor extension specification (v0.6) in Rocket Chip and carried out experiments using Firesim, a cycle-accurate, FPGA-accelerated simulator. After our initial implementation, we've enhanced Rocket with hypervisor-controlled hardware mechanisms to minimize inter-hart interference due to contention in shared memory access structures (e.g., L2 cache and DRAM controller). Furthermore, we've extended the PLIC to take advantage of guest external interrupt support and achieve direct guest interrupt injection with low and deterministic latency to critical guest OSes.In this talk we report our experience with the RISC-V hypervisor extension, present the first publicly unveiled benchmark of a hypervisor running over the extensions, and layout the next steps on how to achieve efficient static partitioning virtualization on RISC-V.Key TakeawaysCurrent state of the RISC-V hypervisor extensions.First public implementation and evaluation of the hypervisor extensions specification in a RISC-V core.What is static partitioning virtualization and what hardware supports it needs to be done efficiently.",

    "description": "This talk touches upon the problem of post-silicon verification of RISC-V microprocessors and development of online test program generators (OTPG). OTPG is a bare-metal application, producing binary code, executing it, and checking results. The proposed OTPG follows the MicroTESK (Microprocessor TEsting and Specification Kit) approach to development of test program generators for functional verification of microprocessors, separating the ISA-independent generation core from the formal specification of RISC-V ISA. MicroTESK OTPG reuses ISA specifications written in the nML language from pre-silicon version of MicroTESK. MicroTESK's RISC-V specifications currently include the following subsets: RV32I, RV64I, RV32M, RV64M, RV32A, RV64A, RV32F, RV64F, RV32D, RV64D, RV32C, RV64C, RV32V. In total, the specifications cover about 250 instructions and can be easily modified to support more instructions. The proposed OTPG has its own separated generation core (in C) and inherits the ISA specifications to allow quick start of post-silicon verification activities. MicroTESK for RISC-V (together with the correspondent OTPG) is distributed under Apache License, Version 2.0.Key TakeawaysThe audience will learn how MicroTESK approach to pre-silicon verification has been extended to the post-silicon case. We will briefly look at recent advances in MicroTESK for RISC-V, including support for new instruction subsets.",

We provide both IP and space qualified chips.The NOEL-V processor family, which is based on the RISC-V ISA, is a new addition to our line of processors. The first variant, HPP64, is a 64-bit high-performance in-order dual-issue processor, with an initial version already released and different configurations under development. This variant has a 7-stage pipeline, can achieve 4.69 Coremark/MHz by initial estimates and supports RV64GCBNH (some extensions are under development). The NOEL-V processors are open sourced under the GPL license. Fault tolerance and additional components for high performance, like L2-cache and a pipelined FPU, can be licensed commercially. The NOEL-V processors are embedded in Gaisler's GRLIB IP library, making it possible to build systems around them using GRLIB.

    "description": "With quantum computers at the horizon, the security of existing asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA and ECC) is about to be broken. The dawning post-quantum age demands for hardware platforms, which support fast and energy-efficient execution of new quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For this, the flexible RISC-V architecture and its advanced instruction set features offer a great opportunity to realize post-quantum cryptography. This paper focuses on how we can exploit the most recent RISC-V Vector Extension Version 0.9 (RVV0.9) to accelerate the quantum-resistant McEliece cryptosystem, which is currently a NIST finalist of the post-quantum standardization. The most expensive calculations in this cryptosystem is the Galois Field multiplication and the Gaussian Elimination Algorithm (GEA). The GEA is essential for the security of the cryptosystem as it scrambles the public key. This scrambling offers a very good potential for acceleration by vector instructions of the RVV extension. In order to evaluate the possible gains,we adopted a rapid prototyping approach based on an instruction set simulator (ISS). We extended the simulator ETISS with a SoftVector library, which allows to quickly model the instructions of RVV. Using the rapid prototyping environment, the GEA was re-implemented and verified for RVV0.9 with a variable size of VLEN and SEW. The final performance gain depends heavily on the memory interface of the vector unit.For different configurations of the memory system, we could profile performance gains of 6x up to 18x for the GEA. This clearly shows the benefit of RVV for implementing quantum-resistant cryptosystems. Key Takeaways: First showcase of the acceleration of a post-quantum cryptography algorithm using the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV0.9). Functional validation and performance profiling with Instruction Set Simulator ETISS using SoftVector, an arithmetic library for vector computations supporting RVV0.9. ETISS is open source available to the RISC-V community. Performance profiling shows a high potential for acceleration using the V-Extension of 6x up to 18x for a key part of the cryptographic algorithm. Speed-up depends heavily on the memory interface. RVV boosts post-quantum cryptography.",

However, most available tools for working with SystemVerilog are proprietary, which prevents them from being widely used in Continuous Integration systems. Also, there\u2019s a range of open source RISC-V cores and IPs implemented in SystemVerilog, which cannot yet be built with open source tools. The same holds true for multiple open source design verification tools, that still can be plugged only into proprietary tooling, holding back the ASIC and FPGA design ecosystem from becoming collaborative and modular. In this talk we will present a number of efforts involving Antmicro aimed at building an open source SystemVerilog ecosystem of scalable and reusable solutions. The presentation will describe the SystemVerilog compliance suite for running various tests against open source tools, the Verible linter/formatter that we develop with Google, as well as the SystemVerilog 2017 pre-processor and parser Surelog, which we are integrating with UHDM. Together with Google we are also working towards integrating it with various open source tools via UHDM, while our collaboration with Western Digital and CHIPS Alliance around Verilator aims to add SystemVerilog features required by UVM. Session Takeaways The audience will learn about the ongoing open source projects that Antmicro and their collaborators are working on to improve ASIC and FPGA design flows.",

    "description": "Convolutional computation kernels are fundamental to today's edge computing applications, among the algorithms used for classification and signal processing applications running on the edge. Interleaved-Multi-Threading (IMT) processor cores are an interesting approach to pursue the highest energy efficiency and lowest hardware cost in edge computing systems, yet they need hardware acceleration schemes to deal with heavy computational workloads like convolutional algorithms and others. Following a vector approach to accelerate convolutions, we explore possible alternatives to implement vector co-processing units in IMT cores, showing the application-dependence of the optimal balance among the hardware architecture parameters. The configurability of the micro-architecture design makes it an optimal candidate for adaptive co-processors in soft-core implementations.Key TakeawaysThe audience will get hints about the trade offs in vector co-processor design for simple edge computing cores, paired with interleaved multi-threading for maximizing efficiency. The small, custom instruction extension sufficient to support typical vector operations in a tiny soft core will be presented. A complete yet very simple library of intrinsic functions to support application development will be presented. Example of source code exploiting the co-processor instructions will be shown. References to the open-source Klessydra processor core family will be given.",

    "description": "AI is moving from the enterprise core to the edge and endpoints. These intelligent systems require heterogenous combinations of compute, storage and acceleration. The RISC-V vector extension is a fundamental requirement for enabling computational intelligence. RISC-V vectors enable the implementation of diverse compute architectures for the spectrum of power and performance constraints required to scale from end points to the edge. It is also key in maintaining software portability across applications from endpoints to the edge therby reducing total cost of operation. SiFive's Vector Intelligence Core IP is architected to enable heterogeneous compute by providing a scalable portfolio of RISC-V vector-enabled CPU IP which can be customized according to the application requirements. In this talk, we present the recent advancements in the RISC-V vector extension, comparisons to other architectures including Arm NEON/Helium/MVE/SVE/SVE2, and recent advancements around extending and optimizing SiFive's vector core IP for intelligence at scale.
